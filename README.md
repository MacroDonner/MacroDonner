# Hi, my name is Myrzaev Akhmet

I'm a self-taught developer focused on backend systems, CLI tools, and Linux development.  
I build practical projects to improve my skills in JavaScript, C++, Node.js, and system-level programming.

- ðŸ”§ Tools I work with: Arch Linux, Neovim, Git
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: advanced C++ (STL, multithreading), networking, and backend APIs
- ðŸ“š I learn by building real projects and studying open-source code
- ðŸš€ I aim to create efficient, minimal, and reliable software

This GitHub is a reflection of my learning process and progress.
